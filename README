This is my first repository which I am pushing on Git.
File my.cnf contains the tweaks for MySql to make it faster.

All you need to do is to clone my reporsitory on your system and then go to folder /etc/mysql/
There you'll find your systems my.cnf file. Just rename your system exixting my.cnf file to my.cnf.old and then copy the my.cnf file from MySql-Tweak to this folder.
That's it! 
Your are done.

All the Best!

Cheers,
